                <p>
                    I was born in Salisbury, NC. I attended Overton Elementary School, Knox Middle School, and
                    Salisbury High School, the same three schools my dad attended 38 years before me. I applied
                    to both Carolina and
                    NC State, but in the easiest decision of my life decided to attend Carolina. I am a senior
                    Computer Science and
                    Political Science major, with a minor in Information Systems.

                <h3 class="heading">Tennis</h3>
                <p>
                    I have played tennis for almost my whole life. My father was a 5.0 tennis player,
                    and his father was an excellent tennis player back in the day as well. I competed
                    in USTA tournaments until I was 14, and then played several years of high school tennis.
                    I put the game down for a few years, but am now picking it back up again with a renewed passion!

                <h3 class="heading">Computer Science</h3>
                <p>My dad ran a computer store when I was little, so I always grew up with at least a few in my
                    house. I dabbled in programming and web development all throughout my childhood, but really
                    the bug when I took AP Computer Science through NCVPS in high school. I decided I wanted to
                    school for Computer Science, and have never regretted that decision for a moment.

                <h3 class="heading">Pickleball</h3>
                <p>Pickleball is a fast growing sport- in fact, the fastest growing in the United States- that
                    combines aspects of Tennis, Badminton, and Table Tennis. It is played on a court around 1/4
                    of the size of a tennis court, and uses a whiffle ball, and solid paddle. It has power, touch,
                    and as an absolutely addicting pastime. I am a semi-professional player, and play in open
                    tournaments
                    all over the Southeast. I have even won some money!

                <h3 class="heading">Golf</h3>
                <p>I have been a golfer since I was in middle school. It's a great
                    pasttime that I share with my brother and father, and we often go
                    to celebrate special events. I also played on the golf team in high
                    school for three years, and had a lot of fun competing in local and
                    state tournaments.
